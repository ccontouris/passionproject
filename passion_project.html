        <h1>Why birds??</h1></div>
        <div class="morewhy"><p>Birds are as much a part of our everday enviroment as tress and grass. They are everywhere
            living
            amoung us. When I stop and look at the birds I'm reminded of the bustling ecosystem constantly adapting to
            survive and thrive, much like us! Birds are great indicators of the health of our enviorment as they are
            resilent
            and adaptable. Once the birds start going you can be sure ecocolgocial collapse is emminent!! So stop and
            take a
            gander at the birds every once in awhile I think you'll be amazed at what you observe!!

            <h2>A bit about the birding community:</h2>
            <p>Chiacgo has amazing birding communinties that
                focus on inclusion. Everything
                from BIPOC bird clubs, feminist bird clubs, as well as anti-war advocacy the birding community is filled
                with
                people from all walks of life standing in unison with one another. The birding community is deeply
                engrained
                in
                enviormental justice we work together to improve the enviroment for all living creatures. We are
                currently
                organzing to petetion the city of Chicago for lights out nights during migrations to protect our birds
                on
                their
                long voyage. Interested in joining the community? Links to inclusive bird clubs here:
